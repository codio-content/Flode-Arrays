Let's look at the 2 array examples we previously introduced.

![](.guides/img/1d-array.png)

This array is represented like this in Flode (and also Javascript as it happens)

```javascript
[12, 5, 79, 51, 62, 7, 0, 84, 23, 5]
```

and our names array 

```javascript
['Richard', 'Alice', 'Jennifer', 'Bob', 'Harry', 'Susan']
```

Notice that to define an array, we surround the *elements* with `[ ... ]` and the array elements are separated by `,`.
