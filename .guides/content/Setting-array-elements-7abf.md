You can easily set an array element with the same techniques.

`numArray[4] = 50` sets the 5th element of array called `numArray` to `100`.

## Defining an array
If you want to create an array and you know the elements already (which is not that often the case) then you can do it like this.

```javascript
numArray = [1, 55, 3, 16]
```

But often you will add elements to the array later, so you can create an empty array like this.

```javascript
numArray = []
```

## Play with the chart
Take a look at the Flode chart on the left. This shows how you 

1. Define a new array
1. Assign values to array elements (note we are not assigning values to *contiguous* elements)
1. Output all the array elements using the Debug block.
